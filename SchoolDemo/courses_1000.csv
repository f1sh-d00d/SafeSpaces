Once we receive this documentation, we will continue to process the proposal in accordance with Policy 605 and the approved curriculum procedures.

What is an “individual study” and is that grammatically correct (I think no)? Per similar comments below: “May be repeated for up to 4 credits...” should be removed from the course description. Pre-reqs: college level biology should be “college-level biology” CLO’s: I understand this needs to be a bit general, but the first CLO is pretty vague. There are no CLO’s that mention any research tasks or skills specifically. They go out of the way to mention the S-STEM scholarships, so certainly there was some language written about student goals for that program. ,10267598 (11/15/2022) 2nd sentence of course description does not follow format.

I updated the justification and other related information to clarify that the SSTEM program is just an example of the use, but that we needed to include lecture hours as this was only lab hours previously. For the discussion of CLOs and the course description, this need to be vague to allow for the maximum flexibility of the class. Since it's used for independent study, that flexibility is essential. The SSTEM program was included as an example and was the reason to modify the course to include lecture hours, but it isn't the only use for this course. This is also a repeatable course, so the number of credits that it can be repeated is essential information and won't be removed from the course description. The suggestion to get help rewriting the course description is inappropriate as the current course description is essential for what the class is intended for.,10610393 (2/16/2023) UCC question, course is offered Fall, Spring and Summer, yet it only has 2 sections per academic year? Concern that 2nd sentence of course description does not follow proper format; recommend changing to ""Includes"". Is the credit ratio correct? Alma Laney explains that because this is a special topics style course, it may or may not be run with multiple sections each semester. ""Right now, we know of two sections (one in the fall and one in the spring) that will be taught for this course, so I didn't want to put down more than the two definite sections. We'd be fine with changing ""May include"" to ""Includes"" though we were using that language as the course may or may not contain that information depending on what is being taught that semester (since it's an open ended special topics course). For the hours, I think this is correct, though we might need to change the number of lecture hours from 1-4 to 0-4 to account for someone wanted to teach 4 credit hours of lab.
