lines so i'll give you the little back and background history on
and one of the important problems a gave rise to calculus
back in their fifteen and sixteen hundred
and then we'll actually look at a problem where that's exactly what we want deals we've got a curve in we want to find a tangent line at a certain point of the curves so
ah right well as die vienna nobody's nobody seems to have questions when he bought the chat just in case
do have questions there
lol right looks like we're good
allen's huge luke sent a message
gonna yeah i think that's what we'll do that's a good thing is to go to microsoft support and see if we can see if we can figure out
how to get the dock him to show bigger so little record better are you guys able to see i see my assignment sheet okay there
yes
nine
well was going to one for a larger problem five and problem sex sell before we get and a problem full of or less talk a little that
about an important problem
that folks tried to find a nice solution to
when calculus was sort of in it's infancy
this is one of the big problems that gave rise to earth
so we have that
grab my straight edge withdraw ourselves a curve
and
so predating calculus the idea of the coordinate system
ah was devised by our friend a card
and once we had a coordinate system mathematics changed drastically
used to be thought that geometry an algebra were separate disciplines but with the introduction of the coordinate system we yeah we realized mathematicians realize that ah
geometry problems can quite often be reef raised in terms of coordinates algebra
so i'm just gonna drop her like that
and our one of the important questions that arose was ah your pick up point under the curve here along the x axis let's just call it a and then we go up to the curve
and then over to the y axis in a course that's the function value at a so that ethel they both their function as called f
right
and one of the questions they wanted to figure out for reasons will find out in a minute was how can i find a tangent to the curve at a given point like point day
now at what is a tangent well tangent our lines come from circles
you draw a circle if you learn gee that you remember your geometry from from middle school and high school
you couldn't draw tangents to circles and their points that just brush the circle and hit him only once ah a line that hits a circle twice as call the seek out line so that terminology carried over so mathematicians talking the fifteen and sixteen hundreds
they were sort of interested
and these more general curves
that they were exploring and they wanted to know how can i find
the equation of a tangent line to a curve at a given point so that became a big a big problem that lots of our folks tried to resolve any got resolved a couple of different ways as some someone not as clean as others so of course the ones are nice and clean
i have come down to earth through time and the other ones are sort of relegated to the history books by finding that red line was an important quest because it gives you information about this function of important so we will get into that in just a second here
and we'll get their via a little physics problem a couple of physics problems so
ah this is called let's just say what this is this is a tangent line
now and you're talking circles
a tangent line really does only hit the circle twice or one sorry and a while a second line hits it twice as whether curve it hits the and hit the curb once locally just right here in may i stand out yet that they hit the function other places but were worried about
the place where just brushes by and touches the curved ones that's why we call it a tangent mine
night and that nice curves like the one we've drawn here have nice tangent lines at all the points so that's what will get into in now in the next little while
let's take a look fell as go to the book if you gotta hand a copy handy turn to page fifty and we will
take a look at i did this yesterday but i'll talk it through it here
mommy
go to page fifty and unless look at problem are one point four point five so problem five and second one point four let me read his introduction and this is given information ah the we with that that we get from physics actually goes all the way back to an to go
galileo our friend galileo with the first one to study the motion of falling objects objects falling under the influence of gravity and as is a slight modification of app
problem five says if a ball is thrown into the air with the velocity of forty feet per second it's hiding in feed use that it's an hour later is given by this formula right here
forty times t insect time and second
minus sixty t squared and ah why is in feet
so i were gonna want to use a half of tea here so so instead of why in our in our calculations so i also called at f of tea so tears time and

ah professor think actually mean yourself
oh my gosh i think there was any actually i'm so sorry are now you're fine with assists local an imax
at at that your bag with your i am why don't i have already that's terrible
so you muted me that the out a while if i do it muted somebody speak up quickly so that we a movie we a mute each other so now we can hear each other
i so here's our let me let me read the question here part a says find the average velocity for the time period beginning when t is two seconds and lasting for another and then there's for ad time intervals and that they give us to calculate the average velocity over so
let's talk about that you guys
right here
we have ah i'm a nice little formula that's given him that given in the homework
ah on the homework assignment page now we're gonna take f of two seconds loss point five so add a formula i gave me bring the formula here we are using formula to here and so we're going to calculate the average velocity over the time and
or ball t y en tu t one plus age and that formula is you take off of t one plus age minor staff of t one and you divide by age and ages the duration of the time interval
ah we all are hold t one faxed and will let age get smaller and smaller that is closer to zero
and as age does you dig it does get closer and closer ah we get a what's called we get closer and closer to what what's called the instantaneous velocity at the fix timed he won so let me put that in context here with our problem
so our t one value years two seconds
and are furnished eight value is point five seconds so we're going to go from two seconds to two point five seconds and we're going to calculate the average velocity and dad and were gonna know proceed add to short nap time interval and to and we're well and at see
what the what the average velocity is doing i'd so here's our here's the formula so we take app of t wine which is to plus the age which is point five minus app of to and we divide by age which is point five are now
this is gives us the correct units for velocity we have ah a certain number of feet here minus a number of feet here so the top as then feet and the bottom of in fraction of the fracked and is in seconds point five seconds so this horrible expression miss
as fraction resulted in number that's feet per second which is average velocity
ah right so let's go ahead calculate this and see what we yet ah i brought my nice calculator today
which i hope you can see if i turn that on
can you guys see that display
i have why one of two point five
are you guys able to see that display or as a too dark knight by you can see it okay good
good i'm going to use i like to use these graphing calculators just because they're so a user friendly with the out with what you see on the screen so we'll get to that in a minute i'll show you how to use this if you've got one like it
so just plugging the numbers them for part one now
now we go app from to plot point five that's two point five minus app of to all over point five so that's what i have here i have ever two point five myself to all over point five now i need to calculate this number and the easiest way to do that
is to do this on my calculator not gonna do this all by hand so i went into white walls if you guys have a calculator like this and i put in a formula for the height after acts seconds here so forty yaks minus sixty next squared and so if you
wanting calculate a value of that function you hit the ad bars button
and you go over to why bars and you yep function and then it gives you a last and you can select whichever function you want minds why won and then i just go why one or two point five and i close the parentheses in gosh a two point five seconds
ah best thing is that zero so urge right here on the x axis so i put zero here
and that at to sack and viking calculate that pretty easily
i had two seconds it's just forty times ah to which is what's that eighty mine as sixteen times for which is sixty four so eighty minus sixty four bear was sixteen i believe
and so that's where i got the sixteen from and then i divide by point five so i get zero minus sixteen oliver point five a net negative thirty two feet per second
so that years the average velocity
that the rock is now noticed we got a negative result so what is a negative result mean in this case well i also grab this function
ah and you can see over here in two seconds are the ball has reached its maximum height and it's now starting back down sell the negative number means that were coming down positive is a positive direction is upward and negative direction is down
lord so a negative velocity of negative thirty two feet per second indicates that the ball is falling back towards the ground at a velocity of thirty two feet per second
ah right so ah again and this and that represents the slope
ah the line connecting ah the point here two point five to the point here too and we draw in that line and that a second line it hits the curve twice it's hard to see but the read the parabola is a little above that
wine
so that the average velocity over the yard the interval from two to two and a half seconds
now are going to shorten an interval we're going to go from two to two point one seconds and as see what we yeah so let's do that so again now i'm getting calculate ah let age be point won in i'm going to get atf of two point one minus half of two oh
or point one and i get ah
here's the calculation just to show yeah
out a duet so i go parentheses a and then i wanna go get my function here why one
me and i will plug in two point one
and then i will subtract
why one
of to
nine clothes that that's the top of the fraction and then divide by point one and there's my average velocity over that at interval that's one tenth of a second so ira are velocity then becomes and negative twenty five point six feet per se
so we time down at interval the velocities changing a and theoretically if we tightened down even more will get a more accurate estimate of what the velocity is right at two seconds so bad that that's more interested in his velocity right at two seconds
now here's the problem to find a tangent liar to find the line you need to points ah by right here if we wanted
calculate the velocity act two seconds we only have one point so that's that's the issue were running into so word timing or using two points and drawing see can't lines and and we're gonna make those hour intervals shorter and shorter and there and that we should get sick and lines who's that slope get
closer and closer to the tangent line slope is the hope i write the next part of the problem said okay ah go point or five seconds
and so you put an ad of two point oh five minus apple to over point or five and now the average velocity and drops from negative twenty five point six feet per second to negative twenty four point eight feet per second and we can go ahead and read
calculate that so and may go over here yeah and we want oh five sell and me
insert here and oh five
delete that minus effort to and then we'll divide by point o five
so now are velocity is than negative twenty four point eight feet per second one we go over that of five one hundredth of a second out from two seconds
and then the last part says okay do it one more time but this time i only got one one hundredth of a second and see what the our average velocity as across one one hundredth of a second so we go app have to point out one minus af of to and we divide by
point a one man will do that again because we can smell was go change things to point a one point a one here
annie awards like are velocity now
over the one one hundredth second interval as negative twenty four point sixteen
so that he is the app
that is the arm
velocity the average velocity between two seconds and two point oh one seconds
i that part a others apart be of this as well
will put right here
notice these numbers are dropping huge time ah but the big drops came in the first few now that now the drops her are are are are much smaller so they say estimate be instantaneous velocity when it he eat laws to
so we want that velocity
at two seconds
so if you are yeah saying you guys why would you say these velocities you're approaching as we get closer and closer to two seconds
negative twenty four yeah negative twenty four a half feet per second is exactly what it looks like we're getting closer and closer to an faq will be able to show that ah in just a little while not today but another day we'll be
able to calculate what's called the derivative of that function which started with and will be able to evaluate the derivative at two seconds and it's going to be twenty four feet per second so the idea of a tangent line was important because it told you how fast as something was che
at a specific instant so of course the axe variable was time i originally but this works even when axes something other than time you can find how fast something is changing
at a given instant so that sort of sounds like time again but a a certain acts value you can determine a rate of change any questions
on ah this first problem where we've found the now the or instantaneous velocity or at least we'd gassed what it was in we guessed correctly
the any particular as you guys wanna wanna talk about could you show the part real pretty equations and the y equals on your calculator of sure yeah let's do that less do that and i'll show you how that worked so if you have one of these key i calculators are any graphing calculator ah you just gotta white walls
and i'll delete it and put it back in so ah if you want to put it and you basically have an axe been here for your variable in ours was get forty and then i pressed the x button
minus i think it was sixteen
an axe and then there's a square button right there
the so now that computer as in memory the why one is equal back to that particular function
make sure that the right function the idea and then as so that's how you put it in
and then you can quit out there now if you want actually evaluate the function again you hit there's a button called vars right here on the third row down and for out for of four columns over you yet that and then there's why bars that your functions
and you hit function that we're working with as a function and then and show you a list from why of why one down to i think white and or something
and so you can you can choose any of those nanda you hit enter and it brings why one and then you just put in parentheses whatever the emperor value is so if it was one point five you just do one point five press enter and and evaluate so at a second and a half after we throw the
all in the air it's twenty four feet near
you know that's that's how that works
so yeah you've ever got one of these calculators it does make calculations little easier which is what they're supposed to do
diane to your question yeah perfect thanks okay go any other questions on problem five
norway okay there
no right well let's try another one of these and let you guys that that you guys look at it
see what you come up with here
the last that
new that one out of the way and less take a look at the next problem ah which was problems sex like i said they were all into three problems three i'm gonna let you guys do by yourself and then five and six that we did i of did five and i'm going to have you not tell me what you get for
sex now and sixers both use formula three so this is an our alternative formula for our velocity so the average velocity over a time interval t want t to can also be found by taking app of t to minus app of t want you guys in physics now
a national in terminal at t to is that terminal time t one is the additional time cj got at t terror app on t terminal minus f of t initial all over terminal minus initial and nana and network t one stays fixed and then we'll laugh at
t to get closer and closer to t won and as we do will get closer and closer to the in the of the instantaneous velocity at time won
xiao was take a walk or guy had that if they wanted to write on that other problem
pardon would that formula have worked for the first problem yes yes all these formulas are interchangeable so yeah yeah honestly when you yeah i left take a lot this is one point was ah for was do problems sex here we're throwing a rock instead of a ball
and we're on mars instead of on earth so the cars with a gravity is different on mars
so let me read you the question it's sad as numbers sex iraq is thrown awkward on the planet mars with an initial velocity and ten meters per second
ah it's height in near his t seconds later is given by this formula so must write it down nonetheless call get call it f m t as well but causal why but was comedy on t
it'll make it easier or we start putting numbers in formula is it's ten times t
mine earth
ah
one point eight six he's weird
my right do i fear that majors out there you guys have theme this undoubtedly be addressed
the kit american equation is yet so yeah the general kinda matic equation for an object falling under that under the influence of gravity and ignoring air resistance is the initial height so you can actually write this
in general
so on earth day it's their it's eight zero the initial hide at the object was v zero t
minus six t and t squared
so that the general ken kinda manic equation for for an object of falling object on the earth so it's financial high plus initial velocity times t minus this is that half of the acceleration due to gravity ah time to t squared so you're probably
see that a timer to and this course and you've probably seen it in other courses as well so good i right i'll straighten it out said don't have to treat your neck here is what it's asking others two parts again we this time we have five time interval
both were going to find average velocity over the given time intervals celeste do one
and one gives us best in are all
to look at it is from one sack hands
to two seconds
nine so that the animal that means all the numbers greater than or equal to one and less than or equal to two
i last ride down our formula year are formula is f ah the t to minus f of t won
yeah that's all divided by
t one man t two
sorry t to and his team one other go on the same order as they are in the top
ah so that's that that the equation i want you to used to calculate this now our gonna hold in this case t one will help will be help fix and then we'll bring out of the terminal at time closer and closer to the initial time so the initial time is one so
well let's go ahead as would be af of to
minus f have won
and then this will all be divided by
two minus one
and we'll ride it out wants and then what is calculated so to my as one of course you guys just one this is just gonna be f of to minus f one so i'll get my calculator and let it do the arithmetic here that's what they're for
and this time i fake i have that one the i have that function as why to
right so he had my bars button
this time i go to why to nan are put to an
mine as why won
whoops
i'm sorry ignore that i pressed too many buttons to quit
night so as put two seconds in their mine us while we get we put one side one second in there
and we get four point four two meters per cent so ah that's how fast the ball now this is rising still that for oil
and for two meters per second
my rights of the ball is still going up in this case it hasn't reached it's peak and started to drop because the velocity as positive south was go ahead
the line under that and now let's move our to sack and a terminal time to a little closer a little closer to the one second initial time so too
asked us to do this and then i'm gonna let you guys calculate and see what you get here and now are our interval goes from one to one and a half seconds
floor in was gonna start at one second and only go to one point five seconds
now
so that means we will have as a one point fine
minus ethel one
then we will divide that
by one point five minus one as point five
so grand calculate that you guys i'll do the same unless the if we agree one what wig yet

got five point three five
callum if they are just get mind around what did you got what'd you that
five point three five five point three fat okay
oh i got something different
oh sorry sorry night and not yet i didn't i forgot to divide by point five
did you say five point three five
yes meters per second
do we have other people who got the same thing
that's why god i put i got a well yeah that's what i got as well
so yeah looks good
i saw it looks like as we get closer to one second
the thing is speeding up a little bit
so the instantaneous velocity might leave faster here
the right let's go to iowa item three here your interval go ahead calculate it ah the third animal goes from one second to one point one seconds
so again that will be at one point one minus africa won
the time we will divide by point won because that's what one minus
one point one minus one is
so take a minute and calculate that
and i will do the same


this time i remember to divide
a point one

i her folks getting this time


i'm i don't trust me i got but i don't fault or own nine for
right and who didn't trust their answer did they get six point nine for as well i just got sex but i don't know aware pretty quiet fianna it adds that around to six point one i did anybody outsource that somebody second and ah the six point nine four
i prepare for their
wait so people are saying yes
yeah
that's what i got to
i just didn't trust my answer i wanted you to confirm just getting just getting my calculator did it
the calculator
lessons broken i think it can do that
beggars okay so it looks like the instantaneous pull off the air
is going to be
closer to
six or seven meters per second
i hear is that there's a couple more these to do so ah go from one sack and to one point o one seconds
so again
ab fab one point o one that's our app of terminal minus f have won which is ah
alpha national
listen a national him and divide that by at one point or one minus one or two point oh one
now you guys do then i'm going do the same here
i got six point three thirty six point is it from price guide good anybody else can burn that
i prefer that i got cool or i am
not gonna have to kick it may have been eager to insert the zeros that i need the right
tell me what you guys got again
six point lap
six point two six
and then i'm getting one for i'm just going to and on because my calculator gave it to me
i you guys getting six point two six one four
i right so we got one more year and then we're going to make that a guess as to what the instantaneous blast the earth
so the last interval that they give us to compute
like froth years from one second
true
ah one points
the should be pretty accurate zero zero one
so
nora test test their compute not a cast go ahead and compute the instant to earlier the average velocity over that short interval one point zero zero one miles alpha for won so one one thousand them a sack him
and then divide that by one one thousandth of a second

in we'll see what you guys yet and then we'll make our nigger guess
as to the instantaneous velocity
i got six point two seven oh one boy
okay i people getting a bank yeah
we just inserting an extra zero here you guys my will tell you what i got
okay
six point
gimme gimme gimme the five decimal places you got
two seven eight when for
dude seven eight one four is correct
he's that's when my calculators as and i believe my calculator
aren't you guys wow so this is that this is the other one you know you could see was sort of getting close to twenty four now what's this getting close to doesn't look like
because that's the next question just like before wallet say why would you say the instant been instantaneous velocity it equals one is
six point three point three million say point three again and i write well i guess i better tested and see if six point three is exactly correct
so i will do that on my calculator
and tell you what i get
i right
so we're saying six point three
right
lind
i did they may a lottery find their gas
six point three the little bit off
six point two eight
six point you eight years and right on the money you got it
yeah part and as was part a you guys
i see if i can sneak pardon be in here somewhere
right there so it turns out
i nodded calculate the instantaneous velocity and you will to shortly it turns out be six point two eight meters per second
nearby sao
while you guys just went through on those last few problems with the idea of a limit so why you are doing we were calculating the that these average velocity is oh a shorter and shorter intervals
and as we do that we get ah we're getting a slope and that flop is getting closer and closer and closer to the slope of a tangent line rider right out in this case
teague was one so ah the slope of a the line at teague was one turns out to be six point two eight and then of course in context of as meters per second and simple and instantaneous velocity
waterfall okay
ah any questions on problem one point four point six
where are we okay with that
that is the basic idea
behind the limits
is there you you take values of some quantity ah closer and closer as you approach some other fixed value and dare you see if there is a nice pattern
that leads to a what we call the limit of the quantity were interested in
i swear to let me read the chat here
ah
right that is right spencer the quizzes one one and one three i won't they won't be anything like what we did today
ah god and
ah okay so ah for quizzes and task for quizzes and court you can look up formulas and quite often i will on attached i'll give you the formula i want you to use as well now going forward there will be some things to memorize ah well we start learning how to take derivatives of function
you'll need to know that process
so yeah there there will be some memorization but on as as you can look things up there for there to help you get ready for the quiz
ah yes as violator banks call on i gotta you guys should have received an email from our as i later and she gave you i can't remember name right off top my head
rice was the last name can remember the first name but anyway yeah she yeah she sent out a little survey for you guys to fill out ah which will determine ah what times are best for you to meet and then once she's gone through those surveys shells that up three times a week
for us to me for you guys to meet i won't be there and show just be a big steady group you guys will work will sit down and and learn about ah the calculator what they were doing in calculus class and she'll prepare you for exams ah she's having ah what's called a these sessions will last an hour or now
early but as i was reading your email she said when tasser are coming up on hold a super session for two hours to prepare be buddy for the exam so ah
oh i'll and i'll get to that question and a minute so anyway yeah look for that email ah her name as somebody rice i can remember first name anyway ah the as she's grey and you guys will be the well benefited if you go to those as i sessions you don't have to go to every one there's not a role taken it's totally
up to you but i would really recommend going as often as you can and and don't miss those superstitions that are you ready for the exam and you can go with it or if you show up you don't have stay the whole time either so i haven't a decimal places do you want us to go ah when we show our work ah
my rule is usually for is plenty ah
now sometimes the book will ask the year will tell you how many guess most around to ah we're gonna learn a technique called newton's rule and the or newton's method with newton's method will probably go out alone further two to six or eight decimals it'll be usually tell
as in the homework
how many decimals to round two and then i'll make a point on quizzed and tas i'm telling you if there's rounding issues at how far to go out as well
so all right
good ah other questions out there folks
the i will find a quiz this week on canvas are going to campus and under files you click file you'll see and it'll just be called the quid homework with one i think is what i named it and so will have fifteen of these things so it'll just be the first one ah
yes i'll josh we will learn how to calculate instantaneous lost the with the formula that's what i did to figure out of the six point two eight number is i found the derivative of the function and then plug dow one in for all the variables and that gave me the school
alias velocity ah
for of at one second sell yeah all that that's actually that's not that's chapter two material so will get into that in chapter two better essentially you've got all the pieces
so so we'll talk about limits for men will apply limits to find derivatives which will give us instantaneous rates
k the queers is do ah i'm ah not okay so let me answer these in order ah the quizzes do you need to upload at my the start of class on monday
so you have the weekend to work on it we don't have a class tomorrow and you guys can work on it and then just ah take pictures of your file work like a nice to meet and an ad change those two pts and upload i'm in a canvas and the a man i can see him now
and i can great of their ah the quizzes not already on canvas body it will be after class i'm just gonna i'm gonna blow was going to show you a copy of a here and then upload it once we're done so let's do that unless you have other questions from the buck i think
we're ready to work the quiz over
see
what i'm expecting off his first queers sell ah right here is quiz won every buddy
sir al gore the instructions with you and and or than all we do a quick look at all the problems and and i think we'll be ready so at first then i include your name and the day
the quizzes either year quizzes are either out of twenty or twenty five whatever and a nice a nice number degrade great amount of so saw the falling problems ah show all work leading to use solutions that any nor demise fashion see my wanna do your your original work your initial
work on scratch paper and then transferred over to this page i think i left you enough room ah so that you can put your final answers and your final work here
are you may use a calculator you're assigned homework problems ah your class pierre's your notes from class and the text book is okay ah correct and correct answers without the work to support them all and yet one point now so if you managed to find the correct answer but you can't just the
via i you don't get four points i you have until monday august thirty first at the beginning of class to solve the problems and outlawed them to campus
ah good luck
work and right carefully and neatly are i'd the first problem there are three problems on this squares the first one is worth four points ah find the domain at the function app of acts which is acts minus two over the square root out eggs were administered the next plus twelve right your answer an interval form so you know
the interval or the domain goes from this extenders acts or whatever
so there's your first problem
second problem
yeah
when you guys print this out i printed it back to back ah and so that i can say paper but you guys i wanna just print one page ad time it'll be easier to photograph and upload that way i think so ah next question is where six points as part of the function app has a domain ago
goes from negative to to to their names acts goes is better than negative to bit smaller than positive to and a range of the function is negative three up to five so that's all the exes this little vertical line here
ah you can read that is sad that so this is accept that and negative to is less than axe is less than two and range the interval negative three to five which means all access that negative three is less than x is less than five find the domain and the range if you can ah of
ap of to acts
epa the square root of acts and af and versa vax assuming be it's all right to assume that does have an inverse so or so members exists and you find the domain and range for the inverse as see your answers will be based on the domain and range bad that i gave you and
the in the problem statement
ah right i'll answer questions here just a second the big problem the one it's worth can i give you two functions square minus two acts and of a square in one minute fact i want you to find a domain in the range for both of those functions
that's part a par be find app of geovax and then find you have ever backs and find those domains
and then part see graph of acts grab this function and then grab this transformation of act mine is too plus three and there's a grid on the next page where you can put all your graphs ah similarly graph geovax or graph this square root function and
then grabbed four times the have to acts
both those on the grid provided for parts see as sandy i show and label at least three points i'm each of the for grass so label put down for points or you can use the grey at that a you don't have to write the coordinates if if if there are right on the grid i can see em all a mall which graph is way
which so this one zappa bags zappa vex minus two plus three and so on and and i would like it if you use a different color for each graph so color code i'm so the weekend not so that i can tell which graph goes with which equation and you can show your work in his base below him in the great
had is on page four here on the back i hope i hope i made a big enough so you can easily fit all for grabs on here
so that your first queers you guys
any questions
ah clarification you want
before our our what time are we so gosh i'll let you out a lot better away today so you can you can go download best thing and i've gotta go gotta go upload it ah and then you guys can i get from campus but any clarification questions you guys have let me read that shit
that
a
okay yeah stop you don't have a printer and then just do your work on paper ah at and and die you know a graph paper if you have it is great for the grass and by yeah you're right it on regular paper and you can take pictures and convert those two pts say
is it ok to do the queer the as long as you can uploaded canvas that will work ah well as the i guess you could make multiple grabs if you don't have colored pencils don't you have that you can't you find our our blue and a black pan and a red pen and and then use a pencil
so i think if you use the different color pans and that would work too
and for monday we will be carrying me look at monday's material year i believe will be doing yes section one point five
on monday so read that section for the book from the block and then now we'll talk about how to do those problems
god i reply of cake impressive
yet not
gosh as stay right there bears they're at their pm questions i'll go ahead and i will upload the quiz right now
and you guys can go get it
get up there there ago
narrowed let me log e n
and
a blood this queers and then i'll make sure it's their gun charity dinner thought
we have to do it again gay
it's just take the second you guys it's gonna get in
the time a couple of pass codes here
to get there

right


i we're almost there

care the go under cameras
go into our class
and when they go to file
see i may have to go actually and a word and a same as to another one less the of this new computer recognizes
nice stuff

right on see
down here
oh it's they're wonderful
okay

oh right you guys areas tired old homework quiz line math twelve and jail d that's just my one drive
and so it is there la mia we get outta here and then hold up to make sure it is all good
it actually yeah okay wow all been out here and make sure everything works for matter correct way it i you guys so there it is therefore pages
thou modern copy at and you guys are on your way
there are good
hey
if you i don't have any questions say you're outta here six minutes early today so if you do have quite and hang around and ah i've got a colossal more chat here
ah oh i brace and ask if we can do all the problems before class on monday at the know you don't need to do a i basically what i would suggest is to read the section and then hopefully a by our you're reading the section and me going it over with going over it with you are we will dive in and do some homework
together to get you started so you just need to read at a that's usually how i do that's now ah what if we can't print it out wow if you can print out and you just gonna have to write it on a piece of paper so copy the questions down ah just like they are and queers and then leave your
south of our room to work and you can do that
and
so yeah you can do it on paper ah and i think it'll be nicest probably if you do it on on printer paper by year you decide if you if you like working on line paper graph paper that's fine too
whatever work for you so
i rights what else i'm hang around till six o five by the way of yeah questions feel free to stick around and ask them
the and get out a canvas here
right very good very good

yeah that's that's what i found out to that i was hoping somebody would say ah here's the facts i went online and google the couple of videos and they told me how that how to select the camera but yeah nobody knew how to how to share the whole thing the camera with everybody so
